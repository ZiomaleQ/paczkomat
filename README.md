Paczkomat project for Object Oriented Programming Course.

Written in Rider, for ease of use I recommend using this (tool)[https://github.com/ZiomaleQ/go-smtp-test], which was created to act as a SMTP server for this application for testing pursposes.

It expects to:
- have a MySQL server running at localhost:3306.
- have a SMTP server running localhost:1025

Detailed settings are contained in Paczkomat/Managers/SettingsManager
